                        <br>I chose to study at RMIT because it has a good reputation and their online courses seem to be the best in Melbourne. I also know lots of people who have gone to RMIT and have a lot of good things to say about courses and learning.<br>
                        <br>While studying at RMIT I hope to learn the ins and outs across the IT industry from coding to physical engineering so I can see what I really like to focus on. I think I’m really interested in coding and automation to make my and other people’s lives easier&nbsp;<br>

                <p class="u-custom-font u-heading-font u-text u-text-4"> The first thing that stitch out to be is working for global brand such as 7-11 as well as their advertising work from options which is something I value highly. A DevOp Engineer role while not particularly being an entry level job focuses on the holistic picture of a product from the idea, creation, production to rolling out to maintenance. It appeals to me because it is a general role where you need to have a lot of knowledge about many different aspect of IT so you can help and advise throughout the whole project. A DevOp Engineer also has a huge focus on Cloud based products which I believe is growth industry with lots of interesting applications.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

                </p>
                <p class="u-custom-font u-heading-font u-text u-text-6"> This job has a focus on Cloud which means you would need to have an understanding and experience with Azure Integration or Amazon Web Services (AWS). A key skill which is required for all the DevOp roles I looked at, is experience in Continuous integration and Continuous Delivery often referred to as CI/CD. Most DevOp Engineer roles require experience as the role has such a wide net of skills and understanding requirement because you have to implement changes to products at all stages of development. This role specifically would also need an understanding of several other programs such as Function Apps, App Services, API Management, Logic Apps, Service Bus and container technology like Docker and AKS.&nbsp;<br>

                </p>
                <p class="u-custom-font u-heading-font u-text u-text-8"> I have leadership experience in working and managing a small team while working in a warehouse. I also have conflict resolution skills which I learned while working customer service while in an office environment, both of which I think would be very applicable to a DevOps role as you have to work within teams to make sure that deliverables are being consistent across the product so updates can be implemented into the product during and post the initial launch.&nbsp;<br>After completing a diploma of Information Technology I would to get a job Junior DevOp at a company that will allow you to learn from hands on experience which I value highly and get other relevant certifications and qualifications such as AWS DevOps certification and an Azure Certification as they are at the moment the two main cloud programs.&nbsp;<br>

The results I got from the test where about what I would’ve expected which were, for the Myers Briggs test; I got Logician with a focus on being an “Analyst” with “Confident Individualism”. I did learning style test on how-to-study.com which came back saying I was a Visual Learner. For the last test I chose the Eysenck Personality Questionnaire which measures your Extroversion/Introversion, Neuroticism/Stability and Psychoticism/Socialisation, which I got Phlegmatic being Emotionally Stable while being Slightly Introverted. These are results I would expect as that is what I generally think about myself and are my strengths.&nbsp;<br>

                  <p class="u-text u-text-6"> These tests have highlighted that I am a more introverted person which means that working in a team, I should force myself to be more communicative with others. I should also focus on my strengths that are highlighted from the tests such as being analytical, I should put myself in positions where I can see data and try and spot patterns.&nbsp;<br>Another that maybe I should be focus on and try and be better at is perhaps my etiquette in terms of how I present ideas to people as sometimes I find myself being as quick as possible as they make sense in my head, I feel like I could work  on perhaps being a better communicator.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

        <h4 class="u-text u-text-1">Motivation</h4>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> Warhammer 40,000 is the most popular tabletop wargame in the world, particularly popular in the United Kingdom however you’ll find a community who play all over the world. I’ve been playing Warhammer on and off for over half my life, however the biggest struggle of getting back or into the game is the ever changing rules and rules bloat. Getting back into a game where the core rulebook is 368 pages long as you can imagine the bookkeeping involved can be frustrating whether that is using pen and paper or going into notes on your phone. Making an easy to use app that can help track points at the minimum would make the game more manageable and approachable.</p>

        <h4 class="u-text u-text-1">Description&nbsp;</h4>
        <p class="u-text u-text-2"> The main feature of this app is a simple tracking tool which will allow you to keep track, store and manage your scoring in a game of Warhammer 40,000. <br>In a traditional Warhammer 40,000 game, there are 3 ways to scoring points in Warhammer 40,000 which is Primary Objectives which caps out at 45 points, Secondary Objectives which you choose at the start of the game and have 3 of which cap at 15 points each for a total of 45 points and finally Mission Objectives which supplement your Primary Objectives points. <br>To start a game it will open a new page with 5 trackers descending with a “Plus and Subtract” with individual caps for each of them with a total calculated at the bottom. The order would be “Primary Objective” tracker  then “Mission Objective” Tracker which cap collectively at 45, then “Secondary Objectives” with 3 trackers that the user customise the names and save the names (this would be so the app can stand the test of time and to get around any potential IP issues)  if they wish, which each cap at 15 each.<br>
          <br>Another feature is that we can add an option for tracking on each turn of the game to provide a more detailed stats and breakdown, this would work by creating a bookmark and saving the stats at a certain time which you can go back to edit if needed. <br>All of these would be doubled for a second player or team so you can track both players or teams scores. I think the hardest part about this would be implementing a user interface that will fit all the information onto 1 screen. I would like to implement several options, at least 3, that allow you to change how your interface is presented so that you can choose your favourite. With this in mind, maintaining a consistent colour scheme for the points tracking so no matter which interface you choose another user who uses a different interface option can still easily see at a glance how and where all the points have been scored.<br>
          <br>Another feature that could be implemented is a menu where a user can store their match history and compare stats from game to game so they can see what is or isn’t working for them. If possible I would like to show these stats on a game by game basis and provide side by side comparisons with perhaps graphs and graphics. If this feature works the way as intended, it could also be implemented into the main points tracker as a way to easily compare what happened over the game.<br>
          <br>Another feature of the app would be a simple calculator that tells you all the results you need to make when making an attack. In Warhammer 40,000 the primary mechanic is rolling dice which are usually testing the strength of a weapon against the toughness of a unit, so if you hit one unit with the same weapon against multiple different units you need different requirements to wound each unit. So I would like to add a calculator that tells a user what they need to roll in this round of combat, after inputting the required stats and adding the modifiers. In addition to this feature it would also give you the expected results from this attack as to give you more information.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br>

                  <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-4"> There is lots of software to help create apps for mobile. The software that I’ve seen which looks most useful and easy to use for someone with little experience in app development. Appy Pie which has many pre-built features which can be implemented in your app, Appy Pie isn't open sourced and is a subscription based software.<br>However looking at open source software, Flutter which was developed by Google which has a lot of support online if you have problems and also has a focus on coding which would be better for learning.

                  <p class="u-text u-text-default u-text-5"> If using Flutter, you would have to learn Dart Programming language for app creation. Flutter has lots of articles, tutorials and examples online to help you so learning these skills should not be too hard.&nbsp;<br>The software that would have to be written would be making buttons to allow users to make inputs, ways to store data and find ways to present the data in an easy to understand way.&nbsp;<br>All the features in this application should be straightforward and be manageable by someone learning like myself.
